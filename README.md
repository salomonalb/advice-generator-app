# Advice Generator App

This project is based on a [challenge from Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).

It consists of an app that fetches a random advice from [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) and updates the DOM with it whenever the button is clicked. 

Its made with HTML, SCSS and Typescript.

To fecth the data I used the Fecth() API, Javascript Promises and Async/Await functions.

The build tool used to compile SCSS and Typescript files is [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

This repository was created using the Github CLI.

This project is deployed with Netlify.
